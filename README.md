# LoopOptimizer

**LoopOptimizer** is a versatile JavaScript utility for optimizing and transforming code with loops. It simplifies your code by converting loops into more efficient and readable map or reduce operations, improving code performance while maintaining readability and conciseness.

## Features

- **Loop Conversion**: Automatically converts `for` loops into optimized `map` or `reduce` operations.
- **Efficiency**: Enhances code efficiency and performance, making your code run faster.
- **Maintainability**: Improves code maintainability and readability.
- **Versatile**: Suitable for JavaScript projects of all sizes.

## Getting Started

Usage: Learn how to use LoopOptimizer to optimize your code.

Examples: 
    const inputCode = `for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                        console.log(i);
                    }`;

    const transformedCode = loopOptimizer.convert(inputCode);
    console.log(transformedCode); 

//Output
    Transformed Code:
    Array.from({ length: 5 - 0 }, (_, i) => {
        console.log(i);
    });

(In this transformed code, the original for loop has been converted into a map operation using LoopOptimizer. Works on dynamic loop body.)
